# Water Detect Sensitivity Test

## Synopsis

We developed a sensitivity analysis algorithm to test all possible combinations of inputs parameters (i.e., spectral indices, maximum clustering, and regularization) for Water Detect within a specified range and assessed accuracy, determining the most accurate inputs for each specific case, and producing a most-to-least accuracy ranking. The developed sensitivity algorithm has four main inputs: 1) the Water Detect default initialization file as per Cordeiro, Martinez, and Peña-Luque (2021); 2) the range of maximum clustering and regularization given by lowest, highest, and step values; 3) the images to be tested, and 4) the ground truth raster to be used in the accuracy assessment.
